# U.S.-Severe-Weather-Event---Data-Visualization
This project analyzes decades of U.S. storm data to uncover trends in frequency, severity, and impacts. While winds, hail, and floods are most common, tornadoes cause the most deaths, hurricanes and floods the greatest losses, with activity peaking in the 1990s–2010s.
